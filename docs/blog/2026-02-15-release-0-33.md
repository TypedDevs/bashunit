## 🔧 New features

### Test output on failure

When a test fails due to a runtime error, bashunit now displays the captured stdout/stderr output directly alongside the failure, making it much easier to diagnose what went wrong.

::: code-group
```[Output]
✗ Failed: test_should_parse_config
  Expected '0' but got '1'
  stdout/stderr:
    parse_config: line 12: unexpected token '}'
```
```bash [Disable]
bashunit --no-output-on-failure tests/
# or
BASHUNIT_SHOW_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE=false bashunit tests/
```
:::

This is enabled by default. Disable it with `--no-output-on-failure` or the `BASHUNIT_SHOW_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE=false` environment variable.

### Suppress progress display

A new `--no-progress` flag suppresses real-time progress output, useful for CI environments or when piping output:

::: code-group
```bash [Usage]
bashunit --no-progress tests/
# or
BASHUNIT_NO_PROGRESS=true bashunit tests/
```
:::

### Opt out of test-level parallelism

Add the `# bashunit: no-parallel-tests` directive at the top of a test file to run its tests sequentially, even when using `--parallel`:

::: code-group
```bash [Usage]
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# bashunit: no-parallel-tests

function test_must_run_sequentially() {
  # Tests in this file won't be parallelized
  ...
}
```
:::

This is useful for test files with shared state or ordering requirements.

## ⚡ Improvements

### Bash 3.0 support

The minimum Bash version requirement has been lowered from 3.2 to 3.0, broadening compatibility with older systems.

### Faster parallel execution

Parallel test execution is now 30-40% faster on large test suites thanks to internal optimizations in the parallel runner.

## 🐛 Bug fixes

- Data providers now work without the `function` keyword on test functions
- Install tests now pass in sandboxed/no-network environments
- Parallel test execution now works correctly in strict mode (`bash -e -o pipefail`)
