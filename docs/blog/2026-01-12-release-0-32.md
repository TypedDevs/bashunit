## 🔧 New features

### Auto-discover coverage paths

Coverage now automatically discovers which source files to track based on your test file names. No more manual `--coverage-paths` configuration needed in most cases.

::: code-group
```bash [Before]
bashunit --coverage --coverage-paths src/ tests/unit/assert_test.sh
```
```bash [After]
bashunit --coverage tests/unit/assert_test.sh
# Automatically tracks src/assert.sh
```
:::

The convention maps `tests/unit/foo_test.sh` to `src/foo.sh`, making coverage setup effortless for standard project layouts.

### Better HTML coverage reports

The HTML coverage report has been improved with better styling and now correctly handles namespaced functions with colons (e.g., `bashunit::assert::equals`).

Additionally, `--coverage-report-html` now defaults to `coverage/html` when no directory is specified:

::: code-group
```bash [Usage]
bashunit tests --coverage-report-html
# Output goes to coverage/html/
```
:::

### Refined hook output display

Hook output now displays with right-aligned timing and a bullet prefix for a cleaner, more consistent look:

::: code-group
```[Before]
Running set_up_before_script... done (2.03s)
```
```[After]
● set_up_before_script                                               2.03s
```
:::

## 🐛 Bug fixes

- Coverage now excludes control flow keywords (`then`, `else`, `fi`, `do`, `done`, `esac`, `;;`, case patterns) from line tracking
- Coverage HTML report correctly handles namespaced functions with colons
- Coverage data no longer lost when running `coverage_test.sh` alongside other tests
