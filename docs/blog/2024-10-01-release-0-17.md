## üêõ  Bugfix

### Fixed simple output [#342](https://github.com/TypedDevs/bashunit/pull/342)

Previously, the simple output was not working for non-succesful tests.
Now, it works as perfectly in combination with the new feature that `displays the failing tests again`.

## üèóÔ∏è New features

### Display failing tests again [#335](https://github.com/TypedDevs/bashunit/pull/335)

Display all failures and errors at the bottom so you have them all together.

### Add test duration [#333](https://github.com/TypedDevs/bashunit/pull/333) [#337](https://github.com/TypedDevs/bashunit/pull/337)

Now, you will know how fast your tests are. This is useful for identifying slow ones that might require extra attention.

### Standalone exit_code output nicer [#336](https://github.com/TypedDevs/bashunit/pull/336)

The stdout will be used for the callable result, while bashunit output will be on stderr.
This way you can control the FD and redirect the output as you need.

```bash [Example]
./bashunit -a exit_code "0" "$PHPSTAN_PATH analyze \
  --no-progress --level 8 \
  --error-format raw ./" 2> /tmp/error.log
```
```[Output]
Testing.php:3:Method Testing::bar() has no return type specified.
```
```[/tmp/error.log]
‚úó Failed: Main::exec assert
    Expected '0'
    but got  '1'
