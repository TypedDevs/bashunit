## 🔧 New features

### Subcommand-based CLI architecture

bashunit now uses a subcommand-based CLI design, making the interface cleaner and more intuitive:

::: code-group
```bash [Commands]
bashunit test [path]      # Run tests (default)
bashunit bench [path]     # Run benchmarks
bashunit doc [filter]     # Show assertion documentation
bashunit init [dir]       # Initialize a new project
bashunit learn            # Interactive tutorial
bashunit upgrade          # Upgrade to latest version
```
:::

The previous flags (`--bench`, `--doc`, `--init`, `--learn`, `--upgrade`) continue to work for backward compatibility.

### Inline filter syntax

Run specific tests directly from the command line using the new inline filter syntax:

::: code-group
```bash [By function name]
bashunit tests/example_test.sh::test_my_function
```
```bash [By line number]
bashunit tests/example_test.sh:42
```
:::

This makes it faster to rerun a single failing test during development.

### Stop at first assertion failure

Tests now stop at the first assertion failure by default, matching the behavior of PHPUnit and Jest. This prevents cascading failures and makes debugging easier.

If you prefer to run all assertions regardless of failures, use the new `--run-all` flag or set `BASHUNIT_STOP_ON_ASSERTION_FAILURE=false`.

### Display skipped and incomplete tests

New options to display skipped and incomplete tests at the end of the test run:

::: code-group
```bash [Usage]
bashunit --show-skipped tests/
bashunit --show-incomplete tests/
```
:::

## 🐛 Bug fixes

- Stop executing remaining commands in `set_up`/`tear_down` after first failure
- Count all tests as failed when `set_up_before_script` fails
- Fixed acceptance tests forcing not showing skipped and incomplete tests

## 🌾 Miscellaneous

- Optimize assertion guard: use integer comparison instead of string comparison
- Optimize string operations with `str::strip_ansi` refactoring
